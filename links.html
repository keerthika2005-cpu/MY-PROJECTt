    <p><strong>About the Galaxy</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diameter: About 100,000 to 200,000 light-years across, though recent estimates suggest it could be on the larger end of that range.</li>
        <li>Number of Stars: Estimated at 100 to 400 billion stars.</li>
        <li>Structure: It's a barred spiral galaxy with a central bulge, spiral arms, and a surrounding halo of stars and dark matter.</li>
        <li>Location of Earth: We're located about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center, in the Orion Arm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong> Top 3 facts about Galaxy</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Galaxies are mostly empty space – Despite containing billions or even trillions of stars, galaxies are incredibly sparse. If the Sun were the size of a watermelon, the next closest star would be over 12,000 miles away.
</li>
    <li>The Milky Way is on a collision course – Our home galaxy is expected to merge with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy in about 4.5 billion years. The result? A new, massive elliptical galaxy nicknamed “Milkomeda”.
</li>
    <li>Dark matter holds galaxies together – Galaxies rotate faster than expected based on visible matter alone. This led scientists to theorize the existence of dark matter, an invisible substance that makes up most of a galaxy’s mass.
